## Polyglot Challenge

### What is a polyglot?

A polyglot is someone who speaks and understands several natural languages.

### Overview

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024, with a twist - I'm solving each day's problem in a different programming language!
This challenge helps explore various programming paradigms and language features while solving interesting algorithmic puzzles.

### Rules

- Use a different programming language for each day
- Complete both parts of each day's puzzle in the same language
- A language cannot be reused (25 unique languages)

## Day 1: Historian Hysteria
Language: PYTHON
