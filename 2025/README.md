## Vim Challenge

### What is Vim?

Vim is a free and open-source, CLI-based text editor.
Vim uses motions to allow traversal and editing documents.

### Overview

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2025 with the use of NeoVim.

### Reasoning

I have chosen this challenge, as I want to:
- Become more proficient with the use of vim motions.
- Explore vim becoming my primary replacement for an IDE, without bottle-necking my current work and projects.
- Explore available plugins and configs for vim.

Many people comment that using vim or emacs is old-school.
However, I believe to become a great programmer; One must become contempt with the terminal.
Vim is a step closer to moving to a terminal-focused routine, and its motions allow more efficient code writing.

### Rules

Before heading into any challenge of this form, I like to set out the rules:
- NeoVim is the only allowed code editor throughout this challenge.
- Any programming language to solve the puzzles is permissible.
- External sources like StackOverflow, Documentation or any public code use are allowed.
- AI use for any coding solution is **not allowed**.
- AI use for understanding and expanding knowledge on Vim (for e.g. motions and plugins) is **allowed**.
